# About Me
## My Interests
* Reading
* Cooking
* Trying new foods (**especially at Food Truck festivals**)
* Anything science fiction, fantasy, or action-packed
* Horror movies
  >My **_ultimate_** all time **favorite** movie genre
## Links to Fun Activites I Recommend
* Axe Throwing
  * I highly recommend [**Urban Axes**](https://www.urbanaxes.com/locations/durham?gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADO881XNS8-RyuDaHCr6xWQ_XPTVb&gclid=Cj0KCQiAhbi8BhDIARIsAJLOlufpY8F2xleg2Xe7NcUQdKWi5Lrb-FPNWwno417PQxkzaaZWnLMVrHIaAlpdEALw_wcB) in Durham
  * This is a great stress reliever and doesn't require you to take your self or your skills too seriously!
* [**Top Golf**](https://topgolf.com/us/)  
  * I went for the first time in December.
  * You don't need to be a golf pro at all.    
  I lost to both my friends, but I had so much fun that it didn't even matter.
* Pottery or clay throwing
  * I highly recommend [**Zebulon Pottery**](https://zebulonpottery.com)
  * My first masterpiece was a wobbly bowl, and I painted it with pride.  It makes an excellent storage place for my car keys and my pocket chapstick!    
* Go Ape Tree Top Adventures
  * I recommend [**Go Ape Tree Top Adventures**](https://www.goape.com/location/north-carolina-raleigh-durham/)  
    I've been to the Williamsburg, VA and Raleigh/Durham Location and had a blast!
    Definitely go during the spring or fall months, or any time when it's not too hot.  You will work up a sweat very quickly!.  My favorite part of the adventure is the zipline!
    >You will **not** be disappointed!
